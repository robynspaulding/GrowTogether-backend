# GrowTogether-backend 
Ruby on Rails API

Why use GrowTogether app? As parents and caregivers know already, remembering the little details can be difficult, especially when you are in "new-born survival mode", and not everyone has experience with babies and kids to know what to look for or how to play with them. 

This is why this app will include:
- Early Childhood Education (ECE) Resources
- Developmental Milestone Tracker
- Reminder feature for appointments and events
- Photo Album
